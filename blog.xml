                Unfortunately, in the big world of business where everything has to be cost-justified, documentation is
                usually seen as a cost, not a benefit. Because “everyone can write”, technical and business writing is
                rarely seen as a valuable profession.
                So, why would you hire a professional writer? What value can they add to your organisation?

            <guid>http://www.knowledgedoc.com.au/blog/articles/business-continuity-and-technical-writing.html</guid>
            <description>
                I recently spent three years working as a Business Continuity (BC) Manager and loved it! Prior to that,
                I spent a very long time in the technical writing field. Many people have asked me how and why I made
                the transition to BC, and it made me reflect on the similarities and differences in the skills needed for the two roles.

            <description>
                EndNote is a great reference management system that’s much more efficient than using Microsoft Word’s citations
                functionality and infinitely better than doing the references manually. EndNote is a program that manages
                a collection of reference information that relates to a particular project.

            <description>
                Managing shapes effectively when creating a vector image helps you avoid mistakes and increase productivity.
                The best way to manage shapes in Illustrator is to create layers for different shape categories.

            <description>
                From Word 2007 onwards a special type of tab stop called an alignment tab has been introduced. You
                can use the alignment tab in headers and footers to automatically readjust the position of the text
                depending on the margins or page orientation.

            <description>
                Microsoft Word documents can be separated into sections. Sections are important for many reasons,
                you can organise your document into chapters with sections and have pages change design and layout
                throughout your document.

            <description>
                Because Australia is part of the Asia-Pacific region, some organisations need to produce foreign-language
                versions of their content. The cost and turnaround time of translating and localising content can be
                significantly reduced by using single sourcing techniques and tools.

                If you’ve set up numbered headings in your Microsoft Word document you
                might be wondering how to coordinate all the other numbers in your document with your headings. This
                article will discuss ways to add chapter numbers to page numbers and caption numbers, in the format of 1-1,
                1-2 for chapter 1 and 2-1, 2-2 for chapter 2. Typically you use the Heading 1 style to signify a new chapter.

                The technical writer is the communication industry’s version of a Swiss-army knife. For any given project
                a technical writer is required to draw upon skills covering writing, graphic design, programming, and
                project management. Achieving this goal means effectively managing and updating your “creative bank” of skills.

                Being creative during the publishing phase is challenging. Unlike the planning and writing phases, which
                have rich creative possibilities, the publishing phase is characterised by rigid output formats and methodical tasks.
                In this article I will discuss employing creativity in the publishing phase.

                Once you have set up your Quick Styles gallery with the styles you use most frequently,
                you should change the order so that your most frequently-used styles are at the beginning of the
                list. This will speed up the style selection process.

                For years I’ve seen the acronym RSS around, or the bright orange RSS symbol
                but it wasn’t until I started managing the Knowledgedoc blog that I actually investigated what these
                things were.  It turns out that an RSS feed is a really great tool for following a blog. In this
                article I’ll introduce you to RSS feeds and how to follow all your favourite organisations.

                Technical documentation must always be accurate and easy-to-understand. This means using unambiguous
                terms, avoiding long sentences, and enabling users to easily find information. This can sound a bit
                dry, but crafting good documentation requires a creative mindset during each project phase.

                Thinking creatively is an essential skill for technical writers. Over three articles I will explore some
                of the ways creativity can be employed during a documentation project. This week is all about the planning
                stage and several ways creativity can help you manage a documentation project.

                We humans forget how old we really are: we contain 14.3 billion year old hydrogen molecules and 3.6 billion year old life-giving molecules such as DNA and its precursors. It’s little wonder that we’re very good at breathing but not so good at driving (since 1888) or using Microsoft Word (since 1983). Project sponsors usually over-estimate the ability of their subject matter experts to use Word to create online content for their end-user audience. I look at some of the steps to reformat and prepare a Word document to import into our authoring tool; enabling us to create a variety of outputs, including online help.

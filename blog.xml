                Once you have set up your Quick Styles gallery with the styles you use most frequently,
                you should change the order so that your most frequently-used styles are at the beginning of the
                list. This will speed up the style selection process.

                For years I’ve seen the acronym RSS around, or the bright orange RSS symbol
                but it wasn’t until I started managing the Knowledgedoc blog that I actually investigated what these
                things were.  It turns out that an RSS feed is a really great tool for following a blog. In this
                article I’ll introduce you to RSS feeds and how to follow all your favourite organisations.

                Technical documentation must always be accurate and easy-to-understand. This means using unambiguous
                terms, avoiding long sentences, and enabling users to easily find information. This can sound a bit
                dry, but crafting good documentation requires a creative mindset during each project phase.

                For over a dozen years we’ve been delivering online help and printable information for the many based on the expertise of the few.
                To produce printable information, we publish from our authoring tool to Microsoft Word and save from there to a PDF.

                Thinking creatively is an essential skill for technical writers. Over three articles I will explore some
                of the ways creativity can be employed during a documentation project. This week is all about the planning
                stage and several ways creativity can help you manage a documentation project.

                We humans forget how old we really are: we contain 14.3 billion year old hydrogen molecules and 3.6 billion year old life-giving molecules such as DNA and its precursors. It’s little wonder that we’re very good at breathing but not so good at driving (since 1888) or using Microsoft Word (since 1983). Project sponsors usually over-estimate the ability of their subject matter experts to use Word to create online content for their end-user audience. I look at some of the steps to reformat and prepare a Word document to import into our authoring tool; enabling us to create a variety of outputs, including online help.

                Creativity is an essential skill for technical communicators, but it must be carefully managed
                to ensure the quality of the content is not being compromised. This article looks at three of the most
                common errors made by writers making the switch from creative to technical writing.

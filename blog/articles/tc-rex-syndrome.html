                    There was a discussion on the Austechwriter email discussion list  about dinosaurs—not the
                    stegosaurus type of dinosaur, but the older members of our profession. The discussion was to do with
                    the use of grammar and punctuation, but it got me thinking about the distribution of ages within our
                    profession. My father was very adamant that he would never move into a retirement village, because
                    it was ‘unnatural’ to be surrounded by people who all belong to the same generation. Now I am firmly
                    in the dinosaur age bracket, I have to say I can finally see his point of view. He felt he needed to
                    mix with all ages to keep him young and interested in life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Practitioners of technical communication in Australia and New Zealand seem to be heavily weighted
                    towards the TC Rex (a technical communication dinosaur) end of the scale. The 2010 TCANZ survey
                    showed that nearly 74% of survey respondents in New Zealand were over 40, and 45% are over 50.
                    Where are the young writers coming in to take over from us with their experience with social media,
                    and all the new technologies? Young people embrace new technology with a passion, while many of us
                    TC Rexes tend to peer cautiously out from behind the trees and wonder how it will affect the way we work.
                </p>

                    <figcaption>Long live the TX Rex!</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    I, like my father, believe that we need a mix of ages to help our profession grow and flourish. We
                    TC Rexes have a lot to offer in the way of skills and experience, but so do young writers. We need
                    to encourage younger people to consider technical communication as a career, and mentor and teach
                    them as well as learn from them. But how do we do this?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only course dedicated to technical communication in Australia, the graduate program in Technical
                    Communication at Swinburne University has closed its doors. There are courses in Australia and New
                    Zealand that have modules in technical communication and Christchurch Polytechnic has a course
                    dedicated to information design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can certainly work as technical communicators without formal qualifications, and many of us have
                    moved into the profession after a previous career or two. If this is the normal entry to the
                    profession, then how do we encourage young people into writing?
                </p>
                <p>
                    One way is to strengthen, build and support our profession and each other. We need to encourage a
                    mix of ages in our workplaces and societies. We need to encourage new ideas and innovation so that
                    we can stay relevant. If we don’t, we TC Rexes will become extinct, and there will be no new writers
                    to carry on. Our jobs will be taken over by journalism graduates and communications specialists.
                    We are a small profession, so we all have a responsibility to share our skills and experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another way is to network, keep up with trends and use every opportunity to promote ourselves to
                    employers and recruitment agencies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, here’s my challenge to all you TC Rexes out there:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>start encouraging younger writers to consider technical communication as a career </li>
                    <li>find someone to mentor </li>
                    <li>think of ways to share your experience and skills with other technical communicators, not just the youngsters</li>
                    <li>get involved! </li>
                </ul>
                <p>And, if you are not a dinosaur, let us know what we can do for you. How can we help you to learn and grow and enjoy what you do? </p>
                <p>We dinosaurs can teach young writers a lot and, conversely, young people can teach us a lot. </p>

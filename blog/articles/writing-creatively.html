                    Technical documentation must always be accurate and easy-to-understand. This means using unambiguous
                    terms, avoiding long sentences, and enabling users to easily find information. This can sound a bit
                    dry, but crafting good documentation requires a creative mindset during each project phase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my last article I discussed how <a href="planning-creatively.html">creativity is essential in the planning phase of a documentation project</a>.
                    In this article I will look at the writing phase and discuss the role creativity can play in the creation
                    of superb technical communication.
                </p>
                <section>
                    <h2>It's not just writing</h2>
                    <p>
                        Firstly, it’s important to realise that technical communication is not just writing. Every piece
                        of documentation is a combination of textual and graphical elements. Increasingly, these elements
                        are being prepared for mobile and web devices as our clients seek to present the most modern and
                        visually appealing documentation possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the writing phase of a documentation project a technical writer will:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>write, edit and proofread content</li>
                        <li>capture and edit digital images</li>
                        <li>design diagrams</li>
                        <li>design logos.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Let’s briefly discuss how creativity can be employed in each of these areas to achieve great results for clients. </p>
                    <section>
                        <h3>Writing content</h3>
                        <p>The general rule of technical writing is to ensure sentences are written clearly and consistently.
                            Since most technical documentation is procedural, this often means writing passages such as:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Click the Firefox shortcut on the desktop.</li>
                            <li>
                                Select <strong>Tools > Downloads</strong> from the main menu.<br>
                                The <strong>Library</strong> window is displayed.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            Being creative means constantly looking for ways to improve documentation and being aware that
                            words aren't always the best mode of communication. This documentation is fine, but it can be
                            enhanced further by replacing the text "Firefox shortcut" with an image of the shortcut and
                            including a tip describing the shortcut (shift+J).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also, although sentences should generally be structured with a leading verb ("Click the…", "Select the…"),
                            this isn’t always the case. Know the rules so that, like an artist, you can know when to break them.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Capturing and editing digital images</h3>
                        <p>
                            One of the most common tasks of documentation projects is taking screen captures to illustrate
                            features such as buttons in a software program or links on a webpage. This is a routine task
                            that shouldn't be overcomplicated, but when you are taking the capture you should think creatively
                            about improving the appearance of the capture.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is it cluttered with extra information that doesn’t help the reader?</li>
                            <li>Could it benefit from a highlight box to draw attention to the feature being documented?</li>
                            <li>Is there white space in the document that could be removed to improve the clarity of the capture?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Tip: Cutting down a capture can also save time when publishing print or PDF documents by ensuring that captures are small enough to fit on the page.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h3>Designing diagrams</h3>
                        <p>
                            Sometimes it is difficult to explain concepts using only words. For example, inserting a new
                            employee into a human resources database might require a profile to be created in a general
                            community database, which then results in certain details being applied to similar records
                            in payroll and staff databases.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In such cases it is useful to create a diagram that demonstrates how the sections relate to
                            one another. The creative aspect of this task is two-fold.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Firstly, you need to be aware of concepts that are complicated and would benefit from a diagram.
                            Secondly, you should carefully consider the actual appearance of the diagram.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Does the diagram clearly illustrate all steps in the taskflow?</li>
                            <li>Are there additional stylistic considerations for the diagram?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            For example, if the company has a signature colour such as Coca Cola red, you might apply that colour to the boxes in the diagram.
                        </p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h3>Designing logos</h3>
                        <p>
                            Every company and most products have logos. Imagine a client supplies their logo in as a small
                            bitmap file for the cover of an A4 document. Drawing on my graphic design knowledge I know that
                            this is a problem because these graphics will pixelate when published at a larger size.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Creativity in this instance is recognising the problem and then drawing on existing knowledge to create a solution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sure, I could simply ask for a bigger larger file and twiddle my thumbs, but why wait? I know what
                            the problem is and it’s easy to create a solution in minutes using a vector image program such as
                            Adobe Illustrator. Now I have a logo that can be recreated in any size.
                        </p>

                    At the heart of writing creatively for technical documentation is being excited about the skills you
                    can leverage to create great results for clients. These tips are just the beginning and I would
                    encourage technical writers worldwide to continuously explore new technologies and consider how they
                    can improve their documentation.

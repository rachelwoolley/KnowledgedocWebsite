                <p>
                    Unfortunately, in the big world of business where everything has to be cost-justified, documentation
                    is usually seen as a cost, not a benefit. Because “everyone can write”, technical and business writing
                    is rarely seen as a valuable profession.
                </p>
                <p>So, why would you hire a professional writer? What value can they add to your organisation?</p>
                <p>
                    Think about all the writing that goes on in your organisation. When you walk into an office these
                    days, everyone is sitting in front of their computer. And what are the majority of them doing; writing!
                    Writing emails, writing reports, writing policies and procedures, position descriptions, organisational
                    communications, business cases, the list goes on. And what are most of the rest of the people doing; reading.
                    Reading the emails, reports, communications. You get the picture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My challenge to you: Have a critical look at your business and see how long people spend writing.
                    Then have a look at how long people spend reading. Can they understand the content on first reading
                    or do they have to re-read one or more times? How much is re-reading or mis-interpretation of information
                    costing your business?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is a quick and dirty way of estimating reading and writing costs. I’ve made up the figures, but
                    you can see that if anything, I have probably underestimated times and salaries. Observe for
                    yourself and work out what realistic figures for your organisation are. For example, you could pick
                    five representative people and get them to keep timesheets for a week to give you some more accurate
                    figures.
                </p>

                        <td>Person hours per week</td>

                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Number of people in the organisation</td>

                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Percentage of time during the day each person spends writing new content or editing existing content</td>
                        <td>20%</td>
                        <td>700</td>
                        <td>$1,000,000</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Percentage of time during the day each person spends reading for the first time</td>
                        <td>20%</td>
                        <td>700</td>
                        <td>$1,000,000</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Percentage of time during the day each person spends re-reading because content is difficult to understand or the meaning is not clear</td>
                        <td>5%</td>
                        <td>175</td>
                        <td>$250,000</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>
                    In this scenario, you are spending five people’s salary per year on an unnecessary task, re-reading
                    unclear content. So, you could potentially hire a writing team with some of this money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And before you say “but I am the only one who knows what I want to write about”, a professional writer
                    is adept at interviewing, and a one hour interview typically translates to eight hours of writing.
                    Also, many business people also find it easier to explain something verbally than write it clearly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A professional writer may also create content at least 50% faster than a business person in one of
                    your departments such as finance, HR, IT, Operations who have different core skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Leave the writing to the professionals and improve the efficiency of your business. Stop seeing
                    writers simply as a cost, have a critical look at how a writer could improve the effectiveness of
                    your staff. Employ a writer and give your key staff more time to THINK. Businesses can only move
                    forward with innovation, progressing new ideas to increase profits or simply provide better and
                    more efficient services. The key focus of people in a business should not be writing.

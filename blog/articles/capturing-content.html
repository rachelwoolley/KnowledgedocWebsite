                <p>
                    I’m a dinosaur when it comes to mobile devices. What did I do when faced with capturing content for a
                    mobile app from an iPhone? Call in one of the children to help of course.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of our long-standing customers recently developed the second version of their mobile app, SynMobile,
                    available from <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/synmobile/id872341591?mt=8" target="_blank">iTunes</a>
                    and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.net.Synergetic.SynMobile&hl=en">Play Store</a>.
                </p>
                <p>In order to document the application, we needed to take screen captures from the various mobile devices that the customer’s app ran on.</p>
                <p>
                    We purchased two Wi-Fi tablets (iPad and Galaxy Tab) and a Galaxy Nexus mobile in 2011 when we started
                    web development. We didn’t worry about iPhones because so many people had them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before I started using the Galaxy Nexus as my personal phone, I found my older phone hard to use.
                    All I could text was ‘OK’. If I was picking up a daughter, in the days before they could drive themselves,
                    I would ‘smash’ the screen with random characters to text them I had arrived. They knew it was time to
                    leave their friend’s place.
                </p>
                <img class="blogImageRight" src="../../images/blog/synmobile-android.png" alt="Synmobile on an Android operating system" title="SynMobile on an Android operating system">
                <p>
                    Eventually, I worked out how to download the SynMobile app to the iOS and Android devices. I got the
                    credentials to use the app using demonstration data via email. I was very happy when I managed to log
                    into my first app. Given I had an Android phone handy, I wanted to try this first to capture screens;
                    as I considered the differences between the mobile operating systems as ‘mostly cosmetic’.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My first problem was how to take screen captures from the Galaxy Nexus phone. I asked ‘Mr Google’ and
                    discovered the answer is to press the ‘reduce sound’ and ‘power’ buttons at the same time – I eventually
                    got there. One good thing I found is that you can easily get access to the files by running the cable
                    between the Android device and the USB port on your PC. Great – I’ve got screen captures I can use,
                    cut down to size and include in the topics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I asked the subject matter experts which operating system they preferred for the screen captures,
                    the answer was iOS; ‘iOS looks a little more polished than android’. How did they suggest I get the
                    screen captures? The ‘iOS simulator’. The what? That’s OK – I’ll get some iPhone screen captures myself...
                    ...Emma, can you please come into the office with your iPhone?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Emma came in with her iPhone. The speed at which Emma found and installed the app impressed me. What
                    about getting the screen captures from the iPhone to my PC? I know that you cannot connect a cable
                    and easily get files like Android devices. Emma suggested emailing them to me.
                </p>
                <img class="blogImageLeft" src="../../images/blog/synmobile-ios.png" alt="Synmobile on an iOS operating system" title="SynMobile on an iOS operating system">
                <p>
                    We worked our way through an early draft of the manual – by now I was familiar with the app, its
                    functions and the representative data. Emma drove the app while I directed where to go, what test
                    data to use and when to take screen captures. Emma took countless screen captures and in a flash
                    each screen capture was emailed and zinging across the WiFi network, the Internet and then back to my
                    PC. Astounding! I thought that it would take ages but the younger generation’s expertise with technology
                    is breathtaking. The iPhone screen captures were well received by the subject matter experts.
                </p>

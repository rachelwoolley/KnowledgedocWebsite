                    Technical writing is consistent, unambiguous, and uses graphics and videos to complement words.
                    Meeting this standard requires a lot of creativity – it’s just behind the scenes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the first in a series of three articles about ways creativity can be employed during a documentation project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This article looks at creativity employed during the planning stage of documentation projects including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>defining the scope of the project</li>
                    <li>communicating with subject matter experts</li>
                    <li>managing risks.</li>
                </ul>
                <section>
                    <h2>Defining the project scope</h2>
                    <p>
                        Defining the scope for a documentation project isn’t simply a case of creating a table of contents
                        with topics for each product feature. You need to think creatively to fully consider the practical
                        needs of users.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Answering the following questions will help define details such as file format, the importance of
                        graphical elements, and whether additional “How to” topics are required. This will in turn clarify
                        the project scope and help you avoid stressful last-minute changes.
                    </p>

                    <section>
                        <h3>How will the documentation be viewed?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Documents can be viewed in a variety of formats. Is the documentation printed or viewed electronically
                            using a desktop PC or mobile device? Mobile formats typically have more graphics and fewer words.
                        </p>
                    </section>
                     <section>
                        <h3>What is the documentation used for?</h3>
                         <p>
                             The practical use of the documentation will determine whether specific “How to” topics are
                             required and the level of detail needed. For example, training documentation can be detailed
                             and include “How to” topics to expand on features, but emergency instructions must be straight to the point.
                         </p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h3>Where will the documentation be used?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Environments can greatly affect how documentation is prepared. For example, a help file loaded
                            onto a cash register might require a graphical approach to help the user quickly navigate topics
                            while facing pressure from waiting customers.
                        </p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Communicating with subject matter experts</h2>
                    <p>
                        Subject matter experts (SMEs) provide feedback and review drafts, but they generally have additional
                        internal roles and responsibilities. Thinking creatively means anticipating the needs of SMEs to ensure
                        the feedback and review process runs smoothly.
                    </p>
                    <section>
                        <h3>When will the SME experience a high volume of internal work?</h3>
                        <p>
                            The job title can give an indication of their responsibilities and when they are likely to
                            experience the highest workload. For example, a software trainer will have more work immediately
                            following a release as users enrol in courses to learn about new features.
                        </p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h3>What is the best way to communicate with the SME?</h3>
                        <p>
                            This question should be asked as a courtesy. Sometimes it is simply easier to reach someone
                            with a particular form of communication. For instance, someone that is frequently on the move
                            might prefer that you call their mobile phone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also consider the perception created by each form of communication. As a general rule you
                            should call when you need a quick answer and email when the question is more detailed,
                            but there are additional considerations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For instance, calling is an excellent option during busy periods because you can personally
                            thank the SME for taking the time out from their schedule to answer your questions. Gestures
                            like this can go a long way in working relationships.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also, emails can seem like demands if they are not carefully phrased. Take your time writing
                            the email and seek a second opinion if you are still concerned that the language and tone is inappropriate.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Managing risks</h2>
                        <p>
                            Risk management is an important factor in every documentation project and it takes creativity to identify potential risks.
                        </p>
                        <p>Generally speaking, there are two types of risk:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>common risks</li>
                            <li>unexpected risks.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Common risks are expected and easily managed. For example, hard drive failure is such a common
                            risk that every company has a management system involving backup drives, additional servers or automated cloud backups.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>budgetary constraints applied to an existing client by a new owner looking to cut costs</li>
                            <li>sudden illness</li>
                            <li>catastrophic risks such as natural disasters.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            By taking time to consider risks that might affect a documentation project you can take actions
                            such as increasing reporting to clearly indicate ongoing costs, establishing delegations to allow
                            projects to continue when key staff fall ill, and ensuring staff understand evacuation procedures
                            to prevent injury during an emergency.
                        </p>

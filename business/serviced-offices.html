                        We are a small company specialising in technical and business writing services. We own and manage
                        an office in the Wheelers Hill Business Centre. We use several of the offices, so personal service
                        is just a door knock away.
                    </p>
                    <p>Work in a welcoming atmosphere:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"The environment is much nicer, more intimate and friendly than a serviced office" - Steve.</li>
                        <li>"It's a very trusting environment: we feel very comfortable trusting Neil" - Tim</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Network with other small business owners:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"If we needed documentation or communications work, it would have been very easy to arrange with Neil "- Tim.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        We are flexible and responsive. If you have a particular requirement, discuss it with us.
                        If we can help, we will! We have owned and operated a small business for over 15 years, and
                        we understand that every business is different.

                    <p>
                        We don't believe in hidden charges or extra fees for daily business needs. Our offices provide a
                        small business with all the infrastructure and amenities it needs without exorbitant fees.
                    </p>
                    <p class="quote">
                        "Renting these offices was much more cost-effective than a typical serviced office - no premium
                        charges on the phones, infrastructure or any other hidden costs" - Steve.

                    <p>
                        In addition to our flexible phone system, we can supply VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol)
                        phones with fast broadband Internet, helping you save money on your phone bills. A two-person
                        business with heavy phone use could save $15,000 a year using VOIP.

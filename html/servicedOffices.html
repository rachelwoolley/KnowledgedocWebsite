                    <h2>A personal touch</h2>
                    <p>
                        We are a small company specialising in technical and business writing services. We own and manage
                        an office in the Wheelers Hill Business Centre. We use several of the offices, so personal service
                        is just a door knock away.
                    </p>
                    <p>Work in a welcoming atmosphere:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"The environment is much nicer, more intimate and friendly than a serviced office" - Steve.</li>
                        <li>"It's a very trusting environment: we feel very comfortable trusting Neil" - Tim</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Network with other small business owners:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"If we needed documentation or communications work, it would have been very easy to arrange with Neil "- Tim.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        We are flexible and responsive. If you have a particular requirement, discuss it with us.
                        If we can help, we will! We have owned and operated a small business for over 15 years, and
                        we understand that every business is different.

                    <p>
                        Setting up your own office and infrastructure can be expensive. We've already done the work for
                        you: our offices are furnished and our network, printers, fax machine, photocopier and phones
                        are all set up and ready to use. The phone system is very flexible and can easily be tailored to
                        your needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>Create a professional look for your clients:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"A lot of infrastructure was already provided - photocopier, fax, printers, phones, systems" - Steve.</li>
                        <li>"Good quality offices, great infrastructure" - Tim.</li>
                        <li>"We've got all the facilities we could need" - Kayleen.</li>
                        <li>"It's easy to access, we don't need permission to come and go, or someone to open or close the doors for us" - Kayleen.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Get started immediately with our easy, ready-to-use setup:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"The ease with which we started was unexpected: almost everything was already done for us and ready to go. That was really good." - Steve.</li>
                        <li>"We were up and running within an hour." - Rodney.</li>

                    <h2>Great location</h2>
                    <p>
                        The location of your office has a big impact on your business. Working within easy distance of
                        shops, amenities, parking and transport is not only more pleasant for you, it makes your business
                        more accessible and enjoyable for your clients.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Wheelers Hill Business Centre is:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Close to Eastlink and the Monash freeway.</li>

                        We don't believe in hidden charges or extra fees for daily business needs. Our offices provide a
                        small business with all the infrastructure and amenities it needs without exorbitant fees.
                    </p>
                    <p class="quote">
                        "Renting these offices was much more cost-effective than a typical serviced office - no premium
                        charges on the phones, infrastructure or any other hidden costs" - Steve.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to our flexible phone system, we can supply VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol)
                        phones with fast broadband Internet, helping you save money on your phone bills. A two-person
                        business with heavy phone use could save $15,000 a year using VOIP.

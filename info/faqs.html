                    <h2>Why do I need documentation?</h2>
                    <p>There are five main reasons:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To make sure everyone in the organisation is working in the most efficient way.</li>
                        <li>To save costs in the long term by minimising support callouts and help desk enquiries.</li>
                        <li>To insure yourself against knowledge loss when people leave the organisation.</li>
                        <li>To comply with regulatory requirements.</li>
                        <li>To enhance your reputation and increase sales of your product by having professional quality documentation to show your customers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Who does Knowledgedoc write for?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our documentation is for your audience. We have the skills to view everything from the
                        perspective of the end-user, whatever the education level or background of that person.
                    </p>
                    <p>As an example, for one of our customers we wrote:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A technical network architecture document for computer network support staff. The document
                            contained language such as Citrix, thin client and other networking jargon.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            An application user guide for staff with limited computer experience. The document included
                            information about how to start up the application and minimised its use of jargon as well as
                            catering to more experienced users.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>What can Knowledgedoc write?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The easiest way to describe what a technical writer writes is anything non-fiction.
                    </p>
                    <p>The materials we have written include:</p>

                    <h2>Why do I need a technical writer?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Technical writers are skilled at producing readable, consistent and user-friendly texts, taking
                        into account the needs of the audience and the stakeholders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As part of everyday business life staff are required to write high quality, clear documentation
                        such as business cases, risk assessments, instruction manuals, training guides, user guides and
                        procedures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Managers and other staff are often left to struggle with documentation and writing tasks
                        themselves. Due to lack of time and expertise the translation and transmission of information to
                        end users and stakeholders can be ineffective.
                    </p>
                    <p>A technical writer can:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>save time and money</li>
                        <li>quietly work alongside your staff to produce clear and concise documentation</li>
                        <li>streamline documentation processes</li>
                        <li>assist growth into the future.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        By employing a technical writer, you are choosing to bring a new a level of expertise into your
                        business environment, whilst at the same time relieving your staff to do what they do best.
